<p> Portraits are my all time style of photography, I love to shoot! With that I have learned a lot of tips and tricks thought out the last couple years.</p>

<p> Starting of with Camera basics</p>

<p> I prefer using Canon product over any thing but starting out I would get the feel for the camera that are displayed in stores to see what you would like, i found the canons to be less bulker and easier to understand.</p>

<p> But overall opinions are opinions, I am not bias  between brands. I want to get started with setting, Each style of camera has a little different of layouts and what each setting type is...</p>

<p> With my experience, I like to use two different times of day/ night,is 9-11am OR 4-8pm because the light is just perfect... Not to light nor not to dark..</p>
<p> Also, It has been the best times for my clients that are reoccuring. While I have only been doing photography for a couple years full time, I have other local photographers as friends and have watched a lot on youtube and webinars to help myself become more educated.</p>
