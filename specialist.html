<h1>Welcome to speical events of my photography.</h1>

<p>Step by step, I want to show you how to create the perfect moment within someones speical day...</p>

                                  <h2>Lets Get started</h2>

<p>I have only had a few clients message me for their speical day... but with that, I try and take in as much as.. For example my friend had her second baby on the way and she had never had a maturity session done</p>
<p> So I took it as an oporunity to essentially get some practice for future requests. Like just recently i did my first engagement session and another one that is more intimate</p>
